This is my first REST API app with blazor front end.
To build and run this app:
1. Required to have SDK for .net 6.
2. Required to create the DB with MSSQL 2019 using the script provided on the host executing the app.
3. Clone the repository and run 'dotnet run .\WorkOutAPI.csproj'.
4. Run 'dotnet run .\WorkOutBlazor.csproj'.
